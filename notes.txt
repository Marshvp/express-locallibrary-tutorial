Models = the basic building blocks of your database. So for every type of entry in your DB (book, author, etc. in our Library Project), 
you’ll create a model that will hold the details of that type of entry. Models define the types of information that get used by your views and controllers.

Views = , of course, the component that generates the UI for your application. 
In our case, we’ve selected a templating engine that uses data supplied by a controller to display the desired information.

Controllers =  the components that decide what view to display and what information is going to be put into it.
